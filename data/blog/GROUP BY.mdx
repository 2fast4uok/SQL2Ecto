The `GROUP BY` command is used to group rows with the same value in a specified column and perform aggregate functions on those groups.

**For Example:**

To count how many records share the same salary in the <a href="/blog/Introduction">`employees`</a> table,


```SQL
select salary, count(salary) from employees group by salary;
```

**Result:**

**Explanation:**

- Salary is selected to appear in the table.
- ount(salary) - counts the occurrences of each salary.
- Group the records by `salary`, meaning all records with the same value in the `salary` column will be grouped.
- `count(salary)` will count the grouped column. For example, three columns were grouped, `count(salary)` will return 3.

### Common Pitfalls


It's crucial to specify columns correctly after `group b y`. For example, attempting to select a column not specified in `group by` will result in an error. for example: 

<img src="/static/images/Pastedimage20231106170049.png" width="1500" />

In this example, an error occurs because job_id is selected but not included in `group by`.

In the above example, after changing the query to:

```SQL
select salary, count(job_id) from employees group by salary;
```

After changing `job_id` to `salary` from being selected, the query works as intended.

# Ecto query for `group by`

In Ecto, use `group_by/3` to achieve similar results:

### [group_by/3](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html#group_by/3)

Required arguments are: 

1. A schema
2. Reference variable for the schema. Refer <a href="/blog/Aliases in Ecto">Aliases in Ecto</a> to understand aliases/reference variables
3. A field for group

**Expression example**


```Elixir
HR.Employee
|> group_by([e], e.salary)
|> select([e], %{"salary" => e.salary, "count" => count(e.job_id)})
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

The above query returns results from grouping `HR.Employees` records with the same `salary`

**Explanation:**

`select([e], %{"salary" => e.salary, "count" => count(e.job_id)})` -> `%{}` is used because the results are wanted in a map. `[e]` is the reference variable. The map returns the grouped `salary` and the count of how many `job_id` share that `salary`.

**Result:**

<img src="/static/images/Pastedimage20231116155334.png" width="1100" />

So, `salary` is grouped, and the count of how many `job_id` of employees with the same `salary` is determined.

#### Keywords

```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from e in HR.Employee, group_by: e.salary, select: %{"salary" => e.salary, "count" => count(e.job_id)})
```

`select:` is a key. `e` is a value that is a reference variable for `HR.Employee`.

In Ecto, aliases are used to set shorter names for modules, allowing you to reference and access everything inside them more easily. Essentially, an alias acts as a variable that refers to a module, simplifying code by reducing the need to type the full module name each time. Aliases can be used in both modules and Ecto queries.


##### **Using Aliases in modules,**

Consider the following example module, `SqlEcto.Hr`, which is created for project functionalities and includes two aliases: `HR.Country` and `HR.Repo`.

In this module,

 - `alias HR.Country` allows us to use Country instead of `HR.Country`.
 - `alias HR.Repo` allows us to use `Repo` instead of `HR.Repo`.


This practice helps developers work more efficiently by using shorter, more convenient names instead of the full module names.


##### **Using Aliases in Ecto Queries,**

```Elixir
HR.Country
|> select([c], c)
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

In this query:

- `[c]` serves as the reference variable (binding) for HR.Country.
- `[c]` represents `HR.Country` throughout the query.

You can choose any name for the binding. For instance:


```Elixir
HR.Country
|> select([country], country)
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

In this example, `country` is used as the binding instead of `c`. It's important to note that the binding should be placed inside a list; otherwise, it will result in an error. This ensures that the output of the query will be a list.

##### **retrieve specific fields,**


```Elixir
HR.Country
|> select([c], [c.first_name, c.email])
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

This query retrieves only the `first_name` and `email` fields from `HR.Country`.


Using aliases in both modules and Ecto queries helps streamline your code, making it more readable and easier to manage.

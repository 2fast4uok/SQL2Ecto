The `HAVING` command is used to perform aggregate functions such as `AVG`,`COUNT`, and `MAX` in a `group_by`. Unlike WHERE, HAVING works specifically with grouped results.


**For Example:**

```SQL
select salary, count(salary) from employees group by salary having count(salary) = 2;
```

Here, we are only returning `salary` and the count of the grouped `salary`only if the count is equal to 2. We are specifying which grouped items should be returned in the table <a href="/blog/Introduction">`employees`</a>. The count should be equal to 2.

**Result:**

In this example, all the grouped salary counts are 2. Thus, we have 2 `employees` earning 8200, 2 earning 4800, and 2 earning 17000.


# Ecto query for `having`

In Ecto, having/3 filters grouped rows based on aggregate conditions.


### [having/3](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html#having/3)


**Expression example**


```Elixir
HR.Employee
|> group_by([c], c.salary)
|> having([c], count(c.salary)==2)
|> select([c], %{"salary" => c.salary, "count" => count(c.salary)})
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

`having([c], count(c.salary)==2)` -> `[c]` is the <a href="/blog/Aliases in Ecto">reference variable</a>. Refer <a href="/blog/Aliases in Ecto">Aliases in Ecto</a> to understand aliases/reference variables
`count(c.salary)==2` -> Here, the `count` function is used to specify that the count of the `salary` should be 2. We are specifying to return the grouped rows where the count of the `salary` is equal to 2.

**Result:**

#### Keyword example

```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from c in HR.Employee, group_by: c.salary, having: count(c.salary)==2, select: %{"salary" => c.salary, "count" => count(c.job_id)})
```

`select:` is a key. `e` is a value that is a reference variable for `HR.Employee`.

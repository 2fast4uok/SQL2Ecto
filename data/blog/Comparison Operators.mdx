In `SQL` and `Ecto`, comparison operators are used to compare values, allowing you to filter results based on specified conditions.

### Comparison operators


In `SQL` and `Ecto`, comparison operators are the same except for the equality operator. In `SQL`, = is used for equality, while in `Ecto`, == is used.


**In `SQL`**

`=` -  Equal to

`!=` - Not equal to

`\<` -  Less than

`\>` -  Greater than

`\>=` -  Greater than or equal to

`<=` -  Less than or equal to

**In `Ecto`**

`==` -  Equal to

`!=` -  Not equal to

`\<` -  Less than

`\>` -  Greater than

`\>=` -  Greater than or equal to

`<=` -  Less than or equal to

### SQL

**Example 1:**

Let's select those records from <a href="/blog/Introduction">`employees`</a> whose salary is **less than** 6000 using the less than (&lt;) operator.


```SQL
select * from employees where salary < 6000;
```

**Result:**

### Ecto


```Elixir
HR.Employee
|> where([c], c.salary < 6000)
|> HR.Repo.all()
```


**Example 2:**

let's select all locations in our table, whose `country_id` is **equal to** 'US', using the equal to (=) operator.

```SQL
select * from locations where country_id = 'US';
```

 ### Ecto


```Elixir
HR.Employee
|> where([c], c.country_id == US)
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

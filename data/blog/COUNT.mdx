The `count` command is used to determine the number of records or non-null values in a column within a table. You can also count the entire table.


**For Example:**


To count the total number of rows in the `employees` table:

```SQL
select count(*) from employees;
```

`\*` refers to the entire table.

**Result:**

Now, let's count the non-null `phone_number` rows.

```SQL
select count(phone_number) from employees;
```

**Result:**

<img src="/static/images/Pastedimage20231116133548.png" width="600" />

You can see that when we counted the entire table using `*` the result was 31, but when I counted only `phone_number` rows, the result was 25. It's because some records have a null value in the `phone_number` column that got removed.

# Ecto query for `count`

In Ecto, you use the count/1 and `count/0` functions to achieve similar results.

### [count/0](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#count/0)

**Expression example**

**For Example:**


```Elixir
HR.Employee
|> select([c], count())
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

Here, `c` is the reference variable that refers to `HR.Employee`. Refer <a href="/blog/Aliases in Ecto">Aliases in Ecto</a> to know about aliases/reference variables.

**Result:**

#### Keyword example

#### [count/0](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#count/0)


```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from c in HR.Employee, select: count())
```

#### [count/1](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#count/1)

**Expressions**

**Example:**

```Elixir
HR.Employee
|> select([c], count(c.phone_number))
|> HR.Repo.all()
```

`count(c.phone_number)` -> We are calculating the count of `phone_number` for `HR.Employee`.`c` is the reference variable referring to the `HR.Employee`.

**Result:**

<img src="/static/images/Pastedimage20231116134048.png" width="800" />

The total number of records that `phone_number` has a non-null value is 19.

#### Keywords

```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from c in HR.Employee, select: count(c.phone_number))
```

`select:` is a key. `c` is a value that is a reference variable for `HR.Employee`.

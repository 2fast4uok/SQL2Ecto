The `AVG` command calculates the average of numerical values in a column.

To find out the average of `salary` from <a href="/blog/Introduction">`employees`</a>.


```SQL
select avg(salary) from employees;
```

**Result:**

The average `salary` in the `employees` table is approximately 8041.94.

# Ecto query for `avg`

In Ecto, you use the avg/1 function to achieve similar results.

### [avg/1](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#avg/1)


**Expression example**


```Elixir
HR.Employee |> select([c], avg(c.salary)) |> HR.Repo.all()
```

`avg(c.salary)` will give the average of column `salary` from `HR.Employee`. Here, `c` is the reference variable that refers to `HR.Employee`. Refer <a href="/blog/Aliases in Ecto">Aliases in Ecto</a> to know about aliases/reference variables.

**Result:**

```Elixir
iex(64)> HR.Employee |> select([c], avg(c.salary)) |> HR.Repo.all()
[Decimal.new("8041.9354838709677419")]
```

**Expressions**

```Elixir
HR.Repo.all(from c in HR.Employee, select: avg(c.salary))
```

`select:` is a key. `c` is a value that is a reference variable for `HR.Employee`.

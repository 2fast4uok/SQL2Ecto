Logical operators allow you to use multiple conditions in a query to filter records based on various criteria. Below are the common logical operators used in SQL and their equivalent functions in Ecto.


#### List of Logical Operators and Equivalent Ecto functions

1. `like` - [like/2](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#like/2)
2. `in` - [in/2](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#in/2)
3. `between`
4. `is null` - [is_nil/1](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#is_nil/1)
5. `and` - [and/2](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#and/2)
6. `or` - [or/2](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#or/2)
7. `not` - [not/1](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.API.html#not/1)

In the following sections, we will explore each of these operators and their usage with the corresponding Ecto functions. Let's dive into each one to understand how they work and how you can use them effectively in Ecto queries.

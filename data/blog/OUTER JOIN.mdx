`OUTER JOIN` include four types

- `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`
- `LEFT OUTER JOIN`
- `FULL OUTER JOIN`

`INNER JOIN` enables you to retrieve only those rows whose values meet the conditions specified in the `ON` clause. On the other hand, `OUTER JOIN` allows one or both of the tables to include unmatched rows.
